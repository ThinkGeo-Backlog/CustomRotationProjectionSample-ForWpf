# Custom Rotation Projection Sample for Wpf

### Description

This project shows how to create your own projection class that allows projecting a layer from any internal projection to any external projection, while doing a rotation at the same time. 

Having the capability to apply those two operations in one step may come in handy if the original layer was created in a different projection with the north at a different angle that you want to align it on the base map. 

This is a Wpf project and you will need references to MapSuiteCore.dll and WpfDesktopEdition.dll to run it.
